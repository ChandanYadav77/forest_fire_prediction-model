# forest_fire_prediction-model
This model is based on the  Random Forest model of Supervised Algorithm.
Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for both classification as well as regression.
But however, it is mainly used for classification problems. As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees means more robust forest. 
Similarly, random forest algorithm creates decision trees on data samples and then gets the prediction from each of them and finally selects
the best solution by means of voting.
It is an ensemble method which is better than a single decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result.
